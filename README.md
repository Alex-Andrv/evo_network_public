## Preparing 
1) Create the virtual environment named evo_network:
```
python -m venv evo_network
```
2) Activate the environment:

```
source evo_network/bin/activate
```

3) Upgrade pip:

```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

4) Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Graph generation

To generate the datasets used in the experiments, run the provided script from the command line:

```bash
python generate_datasets.py
```

This will generate:

âœ… **Small graphs** in the directory:  
`generated_graph/small/` (synthetic networks: BarabÃ¡si-Albert and Watts-Strogatz).

âœ… **Large graphs** in the directory:  
`generated_graph/large/` (real networks: Wiki-Vote, p2p-Gnutella, Facebook, ca-GrQc).

You can customize the output directories or the random seed using the script options:

```bash
python generate_datasets.py --small-dir <small_dir_path> --large-dir <large_dir_path> --seed 123
```

### Graph usage in the paper

ðŸ”¹ **Small graphs**:  
Used for analysis on synthetic BarabÃ¡si-Albert (BA) and Watts-Strogatz (WS) models to study the impact of different parameters on small, controlled networks (see subsection **4.2 Comparing to Exact Solution**).

ðŸ”¹ **Large graphs**:  
Used to evaluate the performance and applicability on real networks from SNAP (Wiki-Vote, p2p, Facebook, ca-GrQc), demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of the approach on large graphs, as well as conducting sensitivity analysis of the method (see subsections **4.4 Evaluation of (1+1)-WEA for Solving TSS** and **4.5 Sensitivity Analysis**).
